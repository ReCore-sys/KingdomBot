Units refer to any troops or population that are inhabiting a tile.
Units can be moved around the map, and can be used to fight and build.
There are currently 6 types of units in the game, each with their own uses.

**Citizen**
These units are your population. They have no combat ability, but can be used to build buildings and work tiles.
Unlike the other units, they don't need to be trained and will automatically generate over time based on your current population.
To construct buildings, you must have at least 1 citizen unit on the tile you want to build on.
Due to having no combat training, citizen units will die if they are attacked by enemy units and won't be able to fight back.

**Soldier**
These units are your basic combat units. They can be trained at the barracks, and are used to fight in combat.
They aren't very strong, but are cheap to train and can be used to defend your cities.
They can kill civilian units, but won't fair well against most other unit types.

**Cavalry**
These guys are fast and very effective against soldiers. While they are more expensive to train, they are also much stronger.
Due to being much faster, troop movements of only cavalry units are much faster than other unit types.

**Ranger**
Long range units that are very effective against soldiers and cavalry. Due to the long range, cavalry units don't stand a chance and are shot down before they can get close.
Unfortunately, they are very expensive to train and can't get through a Knight's heavy armor.

**Knight**
These guys are extremely durable and only weak to other knights. They are very expensive to train, but are very effective against all other unit types.
They are also very slow, so they can't move around the map as fast as other units.

**Scout**
While they have limited fighting ability, they are very useful for scouting out enemy territory.
They can move extremely fast on their own so they can be used to quickly move around the map.
